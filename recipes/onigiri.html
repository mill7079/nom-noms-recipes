        <h3>Preparation of Rice</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by preparing steamed rice. Put rice in a large bowl and gently wash in a circular motion. Discard the water. Repeat this process about 3-4 times.</li>
            <li>Let the rice soak in water for 30 minutes. Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain completely, at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine the rice and water in a heavy-bottom pot. Cover the lid and bring it to a boil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling, turn the heat to the lowest setting and continue to cook covered for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed. At the 12-13 minute mark, take a quick peek and if you see there is any water left, close the lid and continue cooking for another minute or so.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot (with lid on) from the head and let it steam for another 10 minutes. Then transfer the rice to a large plate or baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Fluff the rice with a rice scooper. Let the cooked rice cool a little bit until you can hold rice without burning your hands. However, do not let the rice completely cool down.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Preparation of Onigiri Fillings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For the salted salmon filling: Sprinkle kosher salt on both sides of the salmon fillet. Bake at 425 degrees in a toaster oven or oven for 10-20 minutes. Japanese salted salmon is cooked till well done (more dry and flaky). Break the cooked salmon into flakes and set aside.</li>
            <li>For the umeboshi filling: Place umeboshi on a 10 inch by 10 inch sheet of plastic wrap. Fold in half and squeeze the seed out from each umeboshi. Discard the seeds and keep the umeboshi flesh.</li>
            <li>For the okaka filling: Put katsuobushi in a bowl and add 2 tablespoons soy sauce. Mix to combine. Katsuobushi should be moistened but not drenched in soy sauce.</li>
            <li>For the tuna mayo filling: Put drained canned tuna in a bowl and add 2 tablespoons Japanese mayonnaise and 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce. Mix to combine.</li>
            <li>For the kombu filling: Put the purchased seasoned kombu in a bowl for easy access later.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation of Onigiri</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the nori sheets in thirds.</li>
            <li>First, wet both of your hands with water in order to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands. Then, put some salt in your hands and rub to spread all around your palms. I dip 3 finger tips in kosher salt (if using table salt, only dip 1 or 2 fingers because it is saltier).</li>
            <li>Scoop out a handful of warm rice (about 1/3 cup) into one hand. Create a small well in the center of the rice. Put one kind of filling (about 1-2 teaspoons) inside. Then mold the rice with your hands around the well to cover your filling completely.</li>
            <li>Press the rice around the filling to gently form the rice into a triangle. Your hands should be just firm enough so the onigiri doesn't fall apart. You don't want to squeeze the rice too tight.</li>
            <li>Wrap the onigiri with nori seaweed, and place a little bit of each filling on top of the onigiri so we know which kind it is.</li>
        </ol>
