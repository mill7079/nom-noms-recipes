        <h3>Ingredients for Spätzle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more for boiling</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ingredients for Sauce</h3>

            <li>7 ounces grated Emmentaler or cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped fine</li>

        <h3>Spätzle Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour, eggs, salt, and water in a medium-size mixing bowl. Beat together with a hand mixer until you have a smooth dough that is sticky but not too dense. You're aiming for a consistency that is just loose enough to be pressed through a spätzle press or a colander. Cover the dough and let sit for 1 hour to lt the gluten develop. Maybe start caramelizing the onions here.</li>
            <li>When you're ready to make the spätzle, preheat the oen to 400 degrees F and butter a large baking dish. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, adding a dash of salt. Working with a large spoonful at a time, either press the dough through a spätzle press or scrape through the holes of a colander into the boiling water. The dumplings are done when they float to the surface. Fish out the spätzle and transfer them to a large mixing bowl.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Once all the spätzle are cooked, layer them in your prepared baking dish, alternating spätzle with the cheese, ending with a layer of cheese. Bake for about 15 minutes until cheese is melted and starting to turn golden.</li>
            <li>While the spätlze bake, make the caramelized onions (or, you know, do it earlier if you Actually want caramelized onions). But according to their instructions: melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat and add the onions. Cook until soft, and then add the brown sugar. Continue to cook until the onions are brown and fragrant. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>When the initial bake of the käsespätzle is done, remove from oven, top with the caramelized onions, and return to the oven for another 5 to 10 minutes. To serve, sprinkle with chopped parsley.</li>
        </ol>
