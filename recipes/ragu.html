            <li>1 garlic head</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks, cut into thirds</li>
            <li>2 carrots, peeled and cut into thirds (or smaller, depending on the size of carrot)</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>8 ounces fresh crimini mushrooms, stemmed and quartered</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry red wine</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>12 ounces uncooked bronze-cut durum wheat tagliatelle pasta (or whatever fucking pasta you want, but long noodles are best)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="prep" class="column">
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat boiler to low with oven rack in middle of oven.</li>
            <li>Toss together portobellows, garlic, onion, celery, carrots, and 1 tablespoon oil on a large rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread in a single layer, and broil in preheated oven until vegetables are charred in spots, about 20 minutes, rotating pan and flipping vegetables halfway through. Let cool 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>After cooling, squeeze the roasted garlic out of their skins (discarding the skins) before transferring garlic and vegetables to a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped, about 4 times (potentially more if the carrots are firm); set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium high. Add cremini mushrooms; cook until bottoms of mushrooms are browned, about 3 minutes. Stir and cook until browned on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste and oregano; cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add wine and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in roasted vegetable mixture; season with salt and pepper before removing from heat.</li>
            <li>Cook your pasta in salted water, and <b>reserve 1.5 cups of the cooking liquid when draining</b>. Transfer cooked pasta to skillet with sauce, and return to heat over medium.</li>
            <li>Stir in reserved cooking liquid, 1/2 cup at a time, until sauce is creamy, about 3 minutes. Season with salt to taste. Serve topped with grated cheese.</li>
        </ol>
