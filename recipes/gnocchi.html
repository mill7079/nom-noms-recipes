        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Peel potatoes and add to pot (or peel afterwards so they absorb less water) (or microwave them). Cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a fork or potato masher.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long “snakes”. On a floured surface, cut snakes into half-inch pieces. </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in large pan over medium heat, add favorite spices. Put the boiled gnocchi in the melted butter and cook for like 7-10 minutes maybe or until nice and browned and toasty.</li>
        </ol>
