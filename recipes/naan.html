        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, add the sugar, warm water, and yeast together. Stir to combine well. The yeast should be activated when it becomes foamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, yogurt, salt, and oil to the yeast mixture. Knead the dough until the surface becomes smooth and shiny, about 10 minutes. You may need to add quite a bit of extra flour if the dough is super sticky - if it's too sticky, you won't be able to stretch it, and it won't cook well. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place. The dough should double in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll the dough to an 8 inch circle using a rolling pin or simply stretch with your fingers. Make sure the dough is fairly thin.</li>
            <li>Heat up a skillet (cast-iron preferred) over medium heat and lightly grease the surface with some oil to prevent the dough from sticking to the skillet. Place the dough on the skillet. When it puffs up and bubbles and burnt spots appear, flip it over and cook the other side. Repeat until all naans are cooked. Cooking time for each side is very short, about 15-20 seconds per side. Check frequently to avoid burning.</li>
            <li>Brush the naan with melted butter and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
