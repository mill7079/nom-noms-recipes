    <h4>Total time: 30 minutes  |  Yield: 12 small pancakes</h4>
    <div id="ingredients" class="column">
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups buttermilk, room temperature</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>zest of one orange</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Berries and whipped cream to top</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="prep" class="column">
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, butter, eggs, and sugar. Add half the flour, followed by the baking powder and salt. Add the orange zest and cinnamon. Gradually whisk in the rest of the flour until you have a nice smooth batter that drops easily from a spoon. You may need to add a little extra flour or buttermilk, depending on the size of your eggs.</li>
            <li>Preheat a pan or griddle over medium-low heat. The pan is ready when a drop of water sprinkled on the pan's surface sizzles and dances.</li>
            <li>When the pan is hot, drop the batter onto it. For small pancakes, spoon a couple of tablespoons onto the pan at a time, and for larger pancakes, spoon about 1/3 cup at a time. Let the pancakes cook for about a minute and a half on the first side until the batter in the middle of the pancakes stops bubbling and begins to set. Carefully flip over the pancakes and cook for another minute or so, until both sides are a lovely golden brown.</li>
            <li>Serve warm, topped with desired toppings.</li>
        </ol>
