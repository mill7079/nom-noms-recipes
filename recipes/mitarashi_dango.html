        <h3>Ingredients for Dough</h3>
        <span>If you're using Joshinko and Shiratamako:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup joshinko (Japanese rice flour)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup shiratamako (glutinous rice flour/sweet rice flour)</li>
            <li>2/3 cup warm water</li>
        </ul>
        <span>If you're using Dangoko:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>7 oz dangoko (Japanese rice dumpling flour)</li>
            <li>2/3 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ingredients for Sweet Soy Glaze</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2/3 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons potato starch/cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>Preparation of Dumplings</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients and soak skewers in water.</li>
            <li>Combine shiratamako and joshinko in a bowl (or add just dangoko in bowl, depending on which you're using). Stir in warm (or cold for dangoko) water a little bit at a time while mixing with chopsticks. The flours start to stick together and eventually it forms clumps. Using your hands, combine into one ball.</li>
            <li>Knead until the dough becomes smooth. The texture should be like squeezing an earlobe.</li>
            <li>Make the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Then divide each piece into 2 balls. You will have 16 equal-sized balls.</li>
            <li>Boil water in a pot. Once boiling, gently drop in each dumpling with a continuous motion. We want to cook them all at once, but also keep them in good shapes. Stir the balls occasionally so they don't stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Dumplings will stay on the bottom first but once they are cooked, they will float. Then cook an additional 1-2 minutes. Transfer the dumplings into iced water when they are done.</li>
            <li>Once the dumplings are cooled, drain well and transfer to a tray. Skewer three pieces onto a bamboo skewer. Continue with the rest of the balls and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Preparation of Sweet Soy Glaze</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan without turning on the heat. Potato starch/cornstarch will become lumpy once you add the heat to it, so mix all together first. Then turn on the head and continue to whisk.</li>
            <li>When the sauce becomes thick, remove the saucepan from the head and transfer the sauce to a container or bowl. If you are making the sauce ahead of time, remove it from the heat earlier while the consistency is still not too thick because the moisture will evaporate and the sauce will thicken as it cools. </li>
        </ol>
