            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups old-fashioned whole rolled oats</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon cinnamon, added to taste</li>
            <li>pinch salt, optional and to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 heaping cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1/2 cup raisins or nuts, optional, to taste</li>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl and your poor arm) combine the egg, butter, sugars, vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed until creamed and well-combined, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the oats, flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and optional salt, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the chocolate chips and optional raisins/nuts, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Form approximately 20 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and flatten slightly. Place mounds on a large place or tray, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. (Or, chill dough and shape cookies later).</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, line baking sheet with parchment paper or cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart, and bake for about 11 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; donâ€™t overbake. Cookies firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
