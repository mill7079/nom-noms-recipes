        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>2 to 4 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk, to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the warm water, sugar, salt, and yeast in a medium-size mixing bowl. Gradually add the flour until you have a nice dough that isn't too sticky. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for a couple of minutes, until the dough is smooth. Return to the bowl, cover, and let sit in a warm place for around 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, bring a pot of water to a simmer with a steamer basket or strainer, lightly brushed with oil, set over it. Knead the dough again until smooth, and then divide into halves. Shape each half into a long log, roughly 1 1/2 inches wide. Cut off the ends with a sharp knife, and then cut the log into pieces about 1 inch wide. Dust these lightly with flour, and then place in the steamer. Steam for around 10 minutes, until cooked through.</li>
            <li>If you'd like to fry half of the mantou, warm several cups of vegetable oil over medium heat in a small saucepan. Working in batches, drop 3 to 4 mantou into the hot oil at a time, turning occasionally until they are browned all over. Remove from the oil and let drain on paper towels. Serve with condensed milk for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
