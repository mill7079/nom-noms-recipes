        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and set aside a small baking sheet. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, and then melt the butter in a medium frying pan. Cook the chicken, skin side down, for around 5 minutes, until the skin is golden. Flip and cook for another 5 minutes, and then transfer the chicken to the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Move to the oven and cook for around 15 minutes, until cooked through. Remove from the oven and keep warm while you make the rest of the dish.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, heat the oil in a medium saucepan. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for a minute or two, until soft and fregrant. Add the soy sauce and mirin, cook for a minute, then add the stock. Simmer for around 5 minutes, and then add the mushrooms and sea salt. Simmer for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the broth is cooking, make your soft-boiled eggs. In a small saucepan, bring 1 inch of water to a simmer. Add the eggs, cover, and cook for about 6 minutes. Immediately transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water to stop them from cooking further. When they have cooled, peel and set aside until you are ready to assemble the ramen. When the eggs are done, add more water to the pot and cook the noodles until soft, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the broth is done, divide the noodles between two servings bowls. Slice the chicken breast thinly, and then add one sliced breast to each bowl. Add the scallions, and then slice the boiled eggs in half and add one egg to each bowl. Serve straightaway.</li>
        </ol>
