        <h3>Preparation of Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat milk in a small saucepan over low until just warm – an instant-read thermometer should register 105 – 115 degrees F. Pour into the large bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk in yeast and let sit until foamy, 10 – 15 minutes. You should see a layer of foam on the surface; this means that the yeast is active.</li>
            <li>Add egg, egg yolk, flour, granulated sugar, cardamom, and salt to yeast mixture and mix with dough hook on low speed until well combined. Increase speed to medium and continue to mix until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Gradually add butter 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing to incorporate slightly before adding more. When 6 tablespoons butter are incorporated, mix until dough is smooth, supple, and shiny, 10 – 15 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a large buttered bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel, and let sit a room temperature until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch dough down, cover bowl tightly in plastic wrap, and chill overnight.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Preparation of Filling and Assembly (for step by step pictures, check <a href=https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/circus-bakery-cinnamon-roll-recipe-article>here</a>)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix butter, cinnamon, and 1/2 cup brown sugar in a medium bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Have your tools and filling nearby; you want to work quickly and keep dough as chilled as possible to make rolling more manageable. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper and roll to a 1/4 inch thick rectangle, about 16 inches by 12 inches. Cover with plastic and chill until dough is firm, 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread butter mixture over two-thirds of the dough. Fold plain side over the middle, then fold opposite third over. Roll to a 12 inch by 8 inch rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Slice lengthwise into eight 1 inch thick strips.</li>
            <li>Working one at a time, lay strip on clean work surface with long side facing you. Using your palms, gently twist each end in opposite directions until entire strip is spiraled tightly. Hold one end of strip between a thumb and index finger, and make a cute knotty boi.</li>
            <li>Divide cinnamon twists between 2 rimmed baking sheets, spacing evenly apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, 45-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven, preheat to 325 degrees F. Bake cinnamon buns, rotating pans from top to bottom halfway through, until deeply golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring remaining 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Generously brush syrup over hot buns. If you like a sweeter pastry, wait 5 minutes, then brush again.</li>
        </ol>
