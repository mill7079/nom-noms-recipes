        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 medium-size potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more for boiling</li>
            <li>1/2 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 pound bacon or salt pork</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>2 to 3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter for frying (optional)</li>
            <li>lingonberry jam for serving (or other type of jam)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and then add the potatoes. Cook the potatoes until fork tender, and then drain completely and transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Mash the potatoes, and then add the egg and salt to the hot mash while stirring rapidly. When this mixture is fully mixed, let it sit until it is cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>While the potatoes are cooling, make the filling. Combine the onion and bacon in a frying pan and cook for several minutes, until the onions are soft and golden brown and the bacon is just shy of crispy. Remove to a separate bowl, reserving the grease, and mix in the allspice.</li>
            <li>Set another large pot of salted water on the stove to boil. Once the potato mix is cool enough to touch, mix in the flour a half cup at a time until you have a thick dough consistency that isn't sticky.</li>
            <li>Knead a few times in the bowl, and then begin pinching off pieces a little bigger than a golf ball. Flatten each ball into a disk, and then spoon about 2 teaspoons of the bacon-and-onion mix onto the middle of it. Fold the edges of the dough around the meat to cover it completely, and then roll into a slightly flattened ball to seal the edges. The filling should be completely enclosed with none oozing out. Set aside and repeat until you have used up all the filling and potato.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, drop several dumplings into the boiling water and cook for several minutes, until they float back up to the top. Remove and put on a plate to cool. You can either enjoy the dumplings straight away after boiling, or you can pan fry them in the bacon grease and butter for several minutes, until golden brown on each side. Serve hot with a side of lingonberry jam.</li>
        </ol>
