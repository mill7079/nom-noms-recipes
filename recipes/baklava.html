        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9x13 inch pan.</li>
            <li>Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Unroll phyllo dough, covering with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Cut stack in half to fit pan.</li>
            <li>Place two sheets of dough in pan and butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered. Sprinkle 2-3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should be about 6-8 sheets deep.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, cut into diamond or square pieces all the way through to the bottom of the pan.Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.</li>
            <li>While baklava is baking, make the sauce. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey and simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove baklava from oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool and serve in cupcake papers. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if wrapped up; freezes well.</li>
