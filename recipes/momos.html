        <h3>Bun Dough Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine the warm water, oil, sugar, salt, and yeast. Gradually add the flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until you havea dough that is not sticky and can be kneaded. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for several minutes, adding a little more flour as needed, until soft and pillowy. Place back in a clean bowl, cover with a damp towel or plastic, and set in a warm place to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Filling Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>While the dough is rising, start your filling mixture so it has a chance to cool before you shape the dumplings. Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for several minutes, until soft and just turning golden brown. Add the onion and cook for a few more minutes until soft. Add the tomato paste, the splash of sesame oil, the spices, and some salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Cook this mixture for several minutes, until fragrant. Finally, add the mushrooms, stirring to make sure they are evenly coated with the spice mixture. Let this cook together for around 5 minutes, until the mushrooms are soft and evenly mixed with everything else.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and stir in the peas. In a small bowl or cup, mix the cornstarch with just enough water to dissolve it. Stir this solution into the mushroom pan to help thicken the filling a little.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Dumpling Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Once your dough has risen, divide it into 8 equal pieces (or more if you want smaller dumplings). Roll each piece into a ball, and then flatten to a disc about 4 inches across, flattening the outermost edges a little more. When the filling is cool, divide that into 8 equal portions as well. Holding a circle of dough flat in one hand, add a scoop of the filling to the middle of it. Starting at one edge, gather the dough into a little fold, pressing between your fingertips. From there, continue adding accordion folds as you work your way around the dumpling, turning as you go, until you run out of space. Pinch the last bit closed and give the whole dumpling a little twist to line up the diagonal pleats.</li>
            <li>Place the filling dumplings on small squares of parchment paper and arrange in your steamer. Steam for around 15 to 20 minutes, then take off the heat and let sit for another 5 minutes or so, covered. Best enjoyed the same day.</li>
