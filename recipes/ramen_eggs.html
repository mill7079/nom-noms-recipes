        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a resealable plastic bag, combine soy sauce and mirin (and maybe sugar). If you’re planning to let it marinate for a long time, add a few tablespoons of water.</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. There should be enough water to cover the eggs (1 inch above the eggs). </li>
            <li>When boiling, take out the eggs from the refrigerator and carefully and slowly submerge the eggs into the boiling water with a mesh strainer/skimmer or ladle to prevent the eggs from cracking.</li>
            <li>Immediately reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook the eggs for exactly 7 minutes (6-6 ½ minutes for a runny yolk, 8-9 minutes for a pretty hard yolk). After 7 minutes, immediately take out the eggs and soak in the ice bath to stop them from cooking further. Let them cool for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>The soft boiled eggs are not completely hardened, so gently peel the eggs and place in the sauce bag. Let them marinate overnight to up to 3-4 days in the refrigerator.</li>
        </ol>
