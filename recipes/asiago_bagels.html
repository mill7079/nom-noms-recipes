        <ol>
            <li>In a bread machine pan, place the water, eggs, oil, honey, ½ cup cheese, milk powder, salt, basil, flours, and yeast in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting. Check dough after 5 minutes of mixing, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed.</li>
            <li>When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Shape into 12 balls. Push thumb through centers to form a 1 ½ inch hole. Stretch and shape dough to form an even ring. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes, flatten bagels slightly.</li>
            <li>Fill a Dutch oven two-thirds full with water; bring to a boil. Drop bagels, 2 at a time, into boiling water. Cook for 45 seconds, turn and cook 45 seconds longer. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain well on paper towels.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine egg white and water; brush over bagels. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Place 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 4400 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.</li>
