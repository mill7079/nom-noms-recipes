        <h3>Ingredients for Cake</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup boiling water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ingredients for Frosting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 pints fresh mixed berries</li>
            <li>fresh mint, to garnish</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="prep" class="column">
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and lightly butter and flour two 8-inch round cake pans. In a small bowl, mix together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, and then set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar, and then mix in the eggs and vanilla until you have a nice smooth batter. Add the milk and the flour mixture in alternating batches. Finally, whisk in the boiling water until just mixed. Divide the batter between the two baking pans and bake for around 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and let cool completely before turning out of the pans.</li>
            <li>Once the cakes are cool, mix the frosting. Combine the heavy cream, vanilla, sugar, and cocoa powder in a large bowl, and then beat with an electric mixer for a couple of minutes or until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>To assemble the cake, place one of the cooled cake rounds on your serving dish. Spread a thin layer of the frosting over the top of it, and then arrange a layer of fresh berries over it. Spread another thin layer of frosting on the bottom of the second cake, and then gently place this on top of the first. Spread or pipe the rest of the frosting over the top of the cake, and then stud with remaining berries and mint leaves, to garnish. Serve straightaway. </li>
        </ol>
