        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine all- purpose flour, salt, sugar and baking powder. Add the grated nagaimo and dashi, mix until combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least one hour.</li>
            <li>After an hour, mince the cabbage leaves and cut the pork belly slices. Take the batter out of the refrigerator, and add the eggs, tempura scraps, and pickled red ginger. Mix well until combined. Add the chopped cabbage to the batter 1/3 at a time, mix well before adding the rest.  </li>
            <li>In a large pan, heat vegetable oil on medium heat. When the frying pan is hot, spread the batter in a circle on the pan. They make thicker okonomiyaki (final thickness is ¾ inches), but smaller and thinner is easier to flip. Place 2-3 sliced pork belly (or mushrooms) on top of okonomiyaki and cook covered on medium low for 5 minutes. When the bottom side is nicely browned, flip over. Gently press the okonomiyaki to fix the shape and keep together. Cook for another 5 minutes. Flip over one last time and cook uncovered for 2 minutes. If you’re going to cook the next batch, transfer to a plate.</li>
        </ol>
